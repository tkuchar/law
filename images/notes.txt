How do I work?

Sometimes I do not take responsiblity to do a task that is right in front of me. Instead I wait for another to ultimately do it for me - eg retrieving conformed papers that are sitting
in the fax basket.

I get easily distracted from a task by notes, emails, and other small things.

I get irritated, despondent when presented with some simple tasks - eg seeing papers I have to serve.

I get anxious when I hear people come around the corner.

I work fast.

I surf the internet.

My desk is always dirty or cluttered.

I listen to music.

I don't drink water.

I don't work after I return from lunch.
